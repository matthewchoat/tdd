<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*<p> So for this assignment, I will need to create an app that prints a receipt for 3 different orders and calculate the proper tax and totals the purchased items. </p>
*<p> I will need to design this app from scratch using OOD principles implemented using a TDD approach.</p>
*<p> The client requests for this app are fairly straightforward and the scope of the project doesn't seem to be very large.</p>
